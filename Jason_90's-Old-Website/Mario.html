               <p> Mario is the main character and titular protagonist of the long-running and highly successful video game franchise of the same name. 
                He was created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto and serves as the main mascot of Nintendo. 
                Mario made his first appearance as the protagonist of the arcade game Donkey Kong, released in 1981 (in which he took the alias "Jumpman"). 
                Since Super Mario Bros., his trademark abilities have been his jumping and stomping powers, with which he defeats most of his enemies, and his ability to gain even more powers with a plethora of items, such as the Super Mushroom, the Fire Flower, and the Super Star. 
                Games have usually portrayed Mario as a silent, straightforward character. According to Nintendo's philosophy, this allows Mario to fit in many different genres and roles. 
                In most games, he is the hero that goes on an adventure to save Princess Peach from his arch-nemesis, Bowser, but he has been shown doing many other activities besides adventuring, such as racing and sporting with his younger twin brother, Luigi; his friends such as Yoshi and Toad; and others.
